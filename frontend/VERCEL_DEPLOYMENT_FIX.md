# Fixing Frontend Deployment Issues on Vercel

I've identified and fixed several issues with your frontend deployment that were causing the "Unexpected token '<'" error in app.js. This error occurs when HTML content is being served instead of JavaScript, which happens when there's a mismatch between how your frontend is built and how Vercel is serving it.

## Changes Made

1. **Fixed index.html**:
   - Removed conflicting CDN scripts (React, Chart.js, etc.) since these are already bundled by Vite
   - Updated the script tag to properly point to the Vite entry point
   - Fixed the favicon path

2. **Updated Vercel Configuration**:
   - Enhanced `vercel.json` with proper headers and caching rules
   - Ensured SPA routing works correctly

## Deployment Steps

Follow these steps to redeploy your frontend on Vercel:

1. **Push the changes to your repository**
   - If you're using Git, commit and push these changes to your repository
   - If Vercel is connected to your repository, it will automatically redeploy

2. **Manual Deployment (if needed)**
   - If you're not using Git or Vercel isn't connected to your repository:
     - Run `npm run build` locally to verify the build works
     - Deploy the `dist` directory to Vercel manually

3. **Environment Variables**
   - Make sure your Vercel project has the correct environment variable:
     - `VITE_API_BASE_URL`: Set to your Render backend URL (e.g., `https://smart-irrigation-backend.onrender.com`)

4. **Verify Deployment**
   - After deployment, visit your Vercel URL
   - Open browser developer tools (F12) and check for any errors in the Console tab
   - Verify that your application loads correctly and can connect to your backend API

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check Build Logs**
   - Review the build logs in your Vercel dashboard for any errors

2. **Verify API Connection**
   - Make sure your backend API is accessible from your frontend
   - Check CORS settings on your backend if you see CORS errors

3. **Clear Browser Cache**
   - Try clearing your browser cache or using incognito mode to test

4. **Check Network Requests**
   - Use browser developer tools to inspect network requests
   - Verify that JavaScript files are being loaded correctly

## Additional Notes

- The error "Unexpected token '<'" typically occurs when a JavaScript file is not found, and the server returns an HTML error page instead
- Vite uses a different build structure than traditional setups, so it's important that the entry point is correctly specified
- For React applications, using Vite's built-in bundling is preferred over loading React from CDN
